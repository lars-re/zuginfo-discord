# Discord Train Departure Notifications

*Powered by [Marudor](https://marudor.de)*


## TODO
- Refactor, remove ugly POC code
- More config and usage options
- Docs, Guide


## Functionality:
- Fetches marudor.de departures for both stations every 20 seconds and sends them via the respective Webhook into the respective Discord channel.
- Auto-deletes departured train messages (currently hardcoded)
- Minimal and distraction-free information about delays, cancelations and departures
- Overall very alpha and poorly coded. Made a minimal working example. PRs welcome.
